# AlphaCare Insurance AI Solution - Scripts

This folder contains various scripts used in the AlphaCare Insurance AI Solution project. Below is a brief description of each script:

## Contents

### 1. `data_preprocessing.py`
This script is responsible for cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis. It handles tasks such as missing value imputation, data normalization, and feature extraction.

### 2. `model_training.py`
This script contains the code for training the machine learning models. It includes functions for model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

### 3. `predict.py`
This script is used for making predictions using the trained models. It loads the saved models and applies them to new data to generate predictions.

### 4. `evaluate_model.py`
This script evaluates the performance of the trained models using various metrics. It generates reports and visualizations to help understand the model's effectiveness.

### 5. `utils.py`
This script contains utility functions that are used across other scripts. These functions include data loading, saving models, and other helper functions.

### 6. `visualization.py`
This script is used for creating visualizations of the data and model results. It includes functions for plotting graphs and charts to aid in data analysis and presentation.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run `data_preprocessing.py` to clean and prepare your data.
2. **Model Training**: Use `model_training.py` to train your machine learning models.
3. **Prediction**: Apply `predict.py` to make predictions on new data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate your models using `evaluate_model.py`.
5. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations with `visualization.py`.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the scripts. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.
